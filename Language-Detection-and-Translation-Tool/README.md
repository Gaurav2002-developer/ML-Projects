The Language Detection and Translation Tool is a web application built using Flask (Python web framework) and Jinja templates for frontend rendering. The tool allows users to input any text, automatically detects the language, and translates it into a user-selected target language.

The backend uses natural language processing (NLP) libraries like langdetect for identifying the language and Googletrans (or a similar translation API) for translating the text. Flask handles the server-side logic, while Jinja templates are used to dynamically render user-friendly HTML pages based on the input and output.

Key Features:

Automatic language detection from the given text.

Translation into multiple languages.

Lightweight and responsive web interface.

Modular and scalable backend architecture.

Tech Stack:

Python (Flask)

HTML, CSS (Jinja templating)

Langdetect, Googletrans (for NLP and translation)

This project strengthened my skills in backend API development, template rendering, and working with third-party APIs for language processing.
