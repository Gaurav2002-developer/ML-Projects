# Diabetes-Prediction
The Diabetes Prediction App is a machine learning web application developed using Python, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to enter specific health-related information (like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.) and predicts whether the user is likely to have diabetes using a trained machine learning model.
